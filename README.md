# Hi, my name is David Vivar BogÃ³nez

I'm a **Spanish 17-year-old boy** with a passion for `Computer Science` and `Artificial Intelligence` that might be bordering on obsessionâ€”in a good way of course ðŸ˜Š.
Technology has always fascinated me, but my interest in programming is relatively recent. I started exploring it just three months ago at the moment I write this (started at June 2024).
Since then, I've been learning something new every day, and I'm loving it ðŸ¥°.

I consider myself a **Backend Developer**, mainly on web but many other things too.
`Python` and `Go` are my strongest languages, I have some experience building projects, and I always like to explore new languages like I do with `Nim` and `Zig`.

I haven't had the opportunity to acquire job experience in this field yet, but I'm always working on my skills and building software I find interesting and useful.
